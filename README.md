- 👋 Hi, I’m @ekazevedo
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino, Espressif ESPs, their simulators, Linux (I'm user of).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C language, with some very superficial incursions on HTML, Java, ... assembly if I would work with some particular hardware.
- 💞️ Collaborate: as retired electronic engineer I feel confortable with hardware. Any software touching the "bare metal" is of my interest. But, I still have a long way to go... I'm on the way.
- 📫 How to reach me:
      Best way is edilsonk.azevedo@gmail.com because I watch it more often.
      This one I check too, but, once every 15 days(?).
